            Git is a version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It tracks changes made to the codebase and allows developers to collaborate and manage their code effectively. Git also enables developers to revert to previous versions of the code, resolve conflicts, and maintain a history of changes made to the project.
